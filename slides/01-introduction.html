FIXME JAKE book border
There are three books that I recommend looking into for this course. Definitely
check out my book, Introduction to machine learning with Python. You can find
the PDF on courseworks. My book should be a relatively easy read and it’s quite
short. The second one is Applied predictive modelling by Max Kuhn, which goes a
bit deeper. This is about the level I want to go to in this course. You can get
it for free at springer link, I posted a link in courseworks. These two are
really the essential ones. Finally, there's Elements of statistical learning,
also known as ESL or the stanford book, by Hastie Tibshibani and Friedman is a
classic for a more theoretical view. You can get it for free on the authors
website.

If you want to brush up on your Python skills, I also recommend the Python Data
Science Handbook by my friend Jake Vanderplas.

# What is machine learning?

???

I first want to talk about what is machine learning, and why do we want it. As you’re
in this course, you’re probably already somewhat convinced that it’s useful,
but I briefly want to give my own perspective. In general, today will not be
very meaty and be more a loose collections of ideas and directions. The next
class we will go down to the metal much more.

Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from data. It is closely related
to statistics and optimization. What distinguishes machine learning is that it
is very focused on prediction.

We want to learn from a large dataset how to make decisions for future
observations. You could say that the input to a machine learning program is
the dataset, and the output is a program that can make decisions on future
observations.

Machine learning is really widely used now, and I want to give you some
examples that most of you probably already interacted with today.

# Types of Machine Learning

???

There are three main branches of machine learning.
Who can name them?
---
class: spacious
# Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Reinforcement

???

They called supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
What are they?
This course will heavily focus on supervised learning, but you should be aware
the other types and their characteristics. We will do some unsupervised learning,
but no reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is the most commonly used type in
industry and research right now, though reinforcement learning becomes
increasingly important.

# Supervised Learning

.larger[
$$ (x_i, y_i) \propto p(x, y) \text{ i.i.d.}$$
$$ x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$$
$$ y_i \in \mathbb{R}$$
$$f(x_i) \approx y_i$$
]

???

In supervised learning, the dataset we learn form is input-output pairs (x_i,
y_i), where x_i is some n_dimensional input, or feature vector, and y_i is the
desired output we want to learn.  Generally, we assume these samples are drawn
from some unknown joint distribution p(x, y). In statistics, x_i might be
called independent variables and y_i dependent variable.
What does iid mean?
We say they are drawn iid, which stands for independent identically
distributed. In other words, the x_i, y_i pairs are independent and all come
from the same distribution p. You can think of this as there being some
process that goes from x_i to y_i, but that we don’t know. We write this as a
probability distribution and not as a function since even if there is a real
process creating y from x, this process might not be deterministic.  The goal
is to learn a function f so that for new inputs x for which we don’t observe y,
f(x) is close to y.  This approach is very similar to function approximation.
The name supervised comes from the fact that during learning, a supervisor
gives you the correct answers y_i.

# Generalization

.left-column[
Not only


also for new data:
]

.right-column[$f(x_i) \approx y_i$,


$f(x) \approx y$
]]
???
For both regression and classification, it’s important to keep in mind the
concept of generalization.
Let’s say we have a regression task. We have features, that is data vectors x_i
and targets y_i drawn from a joint distribution. We now want to learn a
function f, such that f(x) is approximately y, not on this training data, but
on new data drawn from this distribution. This is what’s called generalization,
and this is a core distinction to function approximation. In principle we don’t
care about how well we do on x_i, we only care how well we do on new samples
from the distribution. We’ll go into much more detail about generalization in
about a week, when we dive into supervised learning.

# Examples of Supervised Learning
- spam detection
- medical diagnosis
- ad click prediction

???

Here are some examples of supervised learning.
Given an array of test results from a patient, does this patient have diabetes?
The x_i would be the different test results, and y_i would be diabetes or no
diabetes.  Given a piece of a satellite image, what is the terrain in this
image? Here x_i would be the pixels of the image, and y_i would be the terrain
types.

This is often used to automate manual labor. For example, you might annotate
part of a dataset manually, then learn a machine learning model from this
annotations, and use the model to annotate the rest of your data.

---

# Unsupervised Learning
.padding-top[
$$ x_i \propto p(x) \text{ i.i.d.}$$
Learn about $p$.
]
???

In unsupervised machine learning, we are just given data points x_i, that are
assumed to be drawn from an unknown distribution. Usually we want to learn
something about these, such as whether they lie on a low-dimensional subspace,
or whether the data clusters in several groups, or find ways to represent the
distribution compactly.  The goal in unsupervised learning is often much less
clear than in supervised learning, and there is no-one providing a “correct”
answers and no supervisor.

Common examples of unsupervised learning is discovering topics in news articles
or on twitter, or grouping data into clusters for easier analysis.  Another one
is outlier detection, where you ask “does this data look normal” which is
important for fraud detection and security systems.

# Reinforcement Learning

![:scale 100%](images/alpha_go.png)
]

.right-column[
![:scale 100%](images/nao.png)
]

???

The third kind, reinforcement learning, has been in the news quite a bit in the
last year. Has anyone heard of that? Alpha go beat the world champion in go.
Reinforcement learning is about an agent learning to interact with an
environment, with some ultimate goal. The environment could be a go board, and
the goal to win the game. For self-driving cars, the the environment could be
roads, sensed by cameras and laser sensors, and the goal would be to get you
somewhere quickly and safely. Or, the environment could be a social media
platform, and the goal could be to provide you such great content that you
never remove your eyes from your phone again!

# Explore & Learn
.center[
![:scale 80%](images/reinforcement_cycle.png)
]

???

Reinforcement learning is quite different in that you usually don’t work with a
dataset – you work with a whole world. This can be a video game, a simulation,
or the real world. The actions of the agent influence which part of the world
they see and which situations they encounter, and it’s usually impossible to
look at all possible situations, even for something as limited as a go board.
This means in reinforcement learning you can not separate data collection and
learning, which you can do for unsupervised and supervised learning.  There
will be no reinforcement learning in this class, as the techniques are quite different,
and real-world use of this technique is still quite limited.

---

# Other kinds of learning

- Semi-supervised
- Active Learning
- Forecasting
- ...

???

There are other kinds of learning that are somewhere between the three kinds I
just explained. Semi-supervised learning for example is a combination of
supervised and unsupervised learning. Active learning is somewhere between
reinforcement learning and supervised learning. There are also many kinds of
supervised learning where the assumption that data points are independent is
dropped, for example for time series analysis and forecasting.  However, if you
get the three main concepts, the rest will be easy to understand.  Some people,
including the local and famous Yann LeCun think that supervised learning is
fundamentally limited. In particular it doesn’t seem to be how humans learn.
So now you can buy these shirts on redbubble

# Classification and Regression

.left-column[
### Classification
- target y discrete

- Is this patient sick?
]

.right-column[
### Regression
- target y continuous
- How long will it take for the patient to recover?
]
???
So getting back to supervised learning, there are two basic kinds, called
classification and regression.
The difference is quite simple: if y is continuous, then it’s regression, and
if y is discrete, it’s classification.

While it's simple, let me give an example.
If I want to predict whether a one of you will pass the class, it’s a
classification problem. There are two possible answers, “yes” and “no”.  If I
want to predict how many points you get on an exam, it’s a regression
problem, there is a continuous, gradual output space.

There are generalizations of this where we try to predict more than one
variable, but we won’t go into that in this course. The main reason the distinction
between classification and regression is important is because the way we
measure how good a prediction is is very different for the two.
It's not always entirely clear whether it's best to formulate a problem as classification
or regression. If you think of predicting a 5-star rating, there's only 5 different possible
outcomes, so you might think it's classification. But there is also an obvious ordering
between the outcomes, which would make it a regression problem.
Both formulations could work, and there are approaches that combine the two for
this particular problem.

# Relationship to Statistics

.left-column[
Statistics
- model first
- infence emphasis
]
.right-column[
Machine learning
- data first
- prediction emphasis
]

???

Before I’ll go into some general principles, I want to position machine
learning in relation to statistics. I recently got chewed out by a colleague
for doing that. My goal here is not to say one is better than the other.
Actually, there’s really no clear boundary between statistics and machine learning, and
anyone that tells you otherwise is lying. Two of the books I recommended for the
course are actually statistics text books. But I can tell you how the tools
that I’m talking about in this course will differ from what you’d learn in a
typical stats course.

Statistics is usually about inference, often phrased in terms of hypothesis
testing. An example might be a yes-no-question, such as “are women less likely
to enroll in a Data Science Program”, and you have a sample population, for
example this classroom, and you can then try to make an inference about whether
this statement is true. Often this includes making assumptions on how your
sample relates to the general population, say this class vs all of DSI or
Columbia vs all of the US. You might also have a specific model of how the process
behind your question works.

# Relationship to Statistics

.left-column[
Statistics
- model first
- infence emphasis
]
.right-column[
Machine learning
- data first
- prediction emphasis
]

???

On the other hand, machine learning is about prediction and generalization. We
want to learn from past data to predict outcomes on future, unseen data.

We usually want to make statements about individual data points, and we want to
build a model that will work on new data that fulfills our assumptions,
independent of the population we samples. Often we don’t have or need a model
of the process, but we rely on the assumption that our training data is
generated from the same process as any future data will be.

There are statisticians that do predictions and there are machine learning
scientists that do inference, but I find this distinction helpful.

Again I’m not saying one or the other is better, I’m just saying that you should
know what kind of problem you are trying to solve, and what the right tool for
the problem is. And then you can call it machine learning or statistics or
probabilistic inference or data science. The tools you learn in this
class will usually not help you to make yes/no inferences, and they
will only give you a limited insight into the data generating process.

# Goal considerations

???

One of the most important parts of machine learning is defining the goal, and
defining a way to measure that goal. In this way, Kaggle is a really bad way to
prepare you for machine learning in the real world, because they already did
that work for you.  In the real world, people don’t tell you whether you should
use unsupervised learning, supervised learning, classification or regression,
and what’s the right way to cast something as a machine learning task – or
whether to cast it as machine learning at all.

# The Cost of Complex Systems

## Data driven first? yes! (or maybe)
## Machine Learning first: No!

???

My first advice would be, don’t try machine learning. Machine learning systems
are very complex and often fragile. Whether you’re in research or a startup,
don’t immediately start with "oh we can apply deep learning to this". Often
it’s good to collect data, and be able to use data to drive and evaluate
decisions. But including a complex process like machine learning into whatever
you’re trying to do will make it much harder to debug and much harder to
understand.

# Thinking in Context!
# What is the baseline?
# What is the benefit?

???

So think in context of your problem. What do you want to achieve? What is the
easiest way to achieve this? And what will improving over this baseline buy
you?

Let’s go through an example:
Imagine you had an electronics store, but you realized retail is all digital
and you’re closing your store with one big sale to move on. You want to do an
email campaign to tell all your customers about the sale. Is there a machine
learning application here? You could try A/B testing the email message. But
that will only work if you have many many customers. You could use ML to
predict which customers might respond. How do you get the data? Let’s say you
have data. What’s the benefit? None! This is your closing sale. You’ll never
email them again. It doesn’t matter if they’ll include you in your spam filter.
Just email everybody!

# Sidebar: Ethical Considerations

![:scale 30%](images/propublica_compas.png)<br/>
.compact[https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing]

???

There is another area where explainability and transparency matter, and that is
when people’s lives are at stake.
One aspect of machine learning that only recently is getting some more attention is
ethics. There was a recent article in propublica about racial bias in
risk-assessment used in the criminal justice system. Spoiler alert: it’s bad. I
recommend reading the article, it’s quite interesting. This is a black-box
machine learning system created by some company. If they had to provide
explanations, or a more transparent system, the situation would likely be
better. But this is not the only place where ethics plays a role in machine
learning.
